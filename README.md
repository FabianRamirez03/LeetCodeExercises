# Leet Code Exercises.

A collection of resolved exercises from the [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) site. 

In the exercises.py file you'll find the solution that I made and the reference of the problem. There are unit tests for each exercise in the unitTesting.py file with the test cases provided by Leet Code.

These are not the most efficient solutions, but I wanted to keep my original proposal instead of changing with the solutions posted on LeetCode. This helped me to visualize the improvement that I'm having thanks to practice, thanks to the analysis of different pespectives from other developers on the Leet Code Forums
